<sub>This project builds on the work of Thanos Polymeneas-Liontiris (among others) and he consulted with us during the process.</sub>

The first project to roll through Studio Spetons is a collaboration with danish double bass player Adam Pultz. Becoming aware of each other's work we found that we have much in common and decided to collaborate on augmenting a double bass, combining elements from our respective practices in the instrument. See a brief description here:

This project is in continuation of Adam's investigations of his own method of augmenting his instrument[See here](http://www.adampultz.com/feedbackbass/) and my project [the halldorophone](http://www.halldorophone.info/about). We also build on the work of my colleagues from the [Emute Lab](http://www.emutelab.org/) at The University of Sussex, Alice Eldridge and and Chris Kiefer, with whom I have collaborated on their [feedback cellos](https://www.feedbackcell.info/) since a 2016 [ICLI](http://www.liveinterfaces.org/) workshop on this method of augmenting string instruments. Another Emute colleague, Thanos Polymeneas-Liontiris has previously modified a double bass in similar ways (building on the projects mentioned above) and [has documented the process](http://www.nime.org/proceedings/2018/nime2018_paper0071.pdf).
