For the past four years I have been involved in on-going collaborations with colleagues who want to emulate some of the "halldorophone-method" of inducing and articulating string feedback. This is turning into a growing body of work with some variation in approach. It has begun to feel like this work deserves to be collected in one place for anyone wanting to build on, or replicate it. This post will serve as a repository to that end, and I will update it with additions which seem relevant as we go.

The halldorophone-method of inducing feedback can be summed up in the following way: Mechanically Coupled strings (in the same instrument) are "listened to" by string specific pickups, the signals are routed to a gain/mixing stage and the mixed signal is fed to a speaker cone embedded in the soundbox of the instrument. Which, in turn, when it plays back the sound of the strings re-vibrates them, creating a feedback loop.

Although halldorophones are bespoke instruments specifically built to facilitate this method of working with feedbacking strings the basic premise is very simple and can be applied to, pretty much any string instrument configuration. To date I have collaborated (or advised) on cello and double bass modifications to do similar things. [Here is a list](http://www.halldorophone.info/about) of those projects which will be kept updated. The ambition with this post is to give a synopsis of the work on these various projects intended as guidance for anyone embarking on their own modification/augmentation/fabrication of a feedback string instrument in the same vein (if you do, please let me know!).
