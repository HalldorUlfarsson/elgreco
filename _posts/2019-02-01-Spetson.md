Halldór Úlfarsson's lab and workshop is located on Spetson in Athens, Greece. The lab is dedicated to building and developing halldorophones as well as collaborating on experimental musical instruments and performance practices (with some material and design research on the side). This is a diary of the work being done there and will be updated on a project by project basis.
