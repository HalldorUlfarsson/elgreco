Halldór´s artistic practice is focused on his project the [halldorophone](http://halldorophone.info) an electro acoustic string instrument he has been developing for over a decade. The work consists of evolving the design of the instrument and instigating collaborations with artists and institutions on it's use. A common narrative thread in these works is a contemplation of the identity of a new musical instrument aspiring to be part of the canon of accepted musical instruments.

He received his basic training at the Academy of Fine Arts in Helsinki, Department of Time and Space.
