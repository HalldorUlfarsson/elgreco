Studio Spetson has just had it’s first live in residents. My old friends and sometime collaborators the [S.L.Á.T.U.R](www.slatur.is) composer collective was participating in the 26th Tectonics festival (held for the second time in Athens) and used Spetson as staging ground for the festival.

Áki Ásgeirsson premiered XXX° a new composition, featuring a new instrument which required fabrication and bespoke electronics which he built at the studio. He refers to the instrument as a light-synth, it uses laser to transmit signal to the players and sound-generating sub stations. It was very satisfying to have some interesting work being made at the studio and to have a have a house full of good people.
